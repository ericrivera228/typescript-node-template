# Typescript Node Template


#### Running this project

```
npm run build-start
```

#### Seeding another project with this template:
1. Update README.md.
2. Update name in `package.json`.

#### To DO
1. It would be nice to use ES modules instead of CommonJS. However this breaks compatibility with older versions of node. This **should** be fine, but maybe try testign it out before officially committing to this template.
